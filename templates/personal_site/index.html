Hi! I'm Dan Riggs, and am just beginning a job search to go full-time into programming. I've been programming seriously for about five years to enhance my work as a linguist and musician, and also because I actually think it's a lot fun. As of early 2017 I've been back to making a living working in my original field, as a professional musician, but for a little over a decade and up until very recently I was in academia, studying and teaching Spanish, Portuguese, Linguistics and Spanish literature. Check out the sections below for more info if you're interested.

			<p>{% blocktrans %}Hi! It seems I've invited you to the party early. This site will be more presentable by the end of the week. Check out <a href="https://github.com/dantheman39" target="_blank">my github page</a> for a similar view of sparseness. I have been programming a lot over the past 5 years or so, but use a private git server so it's going to take time to make my code more presentable.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

			<p>{% blocktrans %}Even though this site is not yet much to look at, I'm happy that it's all set up for i18n internationalization and and for unit testing, two areas I wanted to know more about, so there's that!{% endblocktrans %}</p>

I've always been fascinated by foreign languages, but never had the chance to really learn one, so after graduating from conservatory I decided to take my self-taught Spanish to the next level and moved to Guatemala to enroll in a Spanish immersion program, specifically at the <a href="plqe.org">Proyecto lingüístico quetzalteco de español</a>. It was a wonderful, life-changing experience, and I learned Spanish well enough in the 5 months I was there that I was able to pass an entrance exam into the Master of Spanish program at The City College of New York.

While at CCNY I taught undergraduate Spanish classes as well as an introductory course in Latin American Literature. I also took a trip one summer to Brazil, fell in love with the language, the music and the people, and later began teaching Portuguese and Spanish in LaGuardia Community College. Since there's still a lot more fun to be had with Iberian languages, I also learned Catalan with the help of books and friends.

After completing the Master's, I moved to Washington D.C. to begin a PhD program in Linguistics offered by the Spanish and Portuguese department. There I earned an MS in Spanish Linguistics, taught Spanish and Portuguese language classes, Spanish phonology, and published a couple of things (literally). My focus was on Phonology (the study of speech sounds and how our minds analyze speech sounds), Orthography (writing systems) and how these interact with Second Language Acquisition.
