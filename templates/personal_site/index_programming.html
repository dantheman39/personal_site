	<p>{% blocktrans %}If I had to categorize the type of programming I'm most comfortable with, I would say that I'm a full-stack web programmer, having built several web apps from the ground up that have been used successfully in data collection for a few years. But beyond the web I have applied my programming skills to multiple challenges: creating desktop applications for my language students, or for psycholinguistic and phonological experiments; running statistical analyses and creating visualizations of data; or just writing the odd bash or python program when faced with a repetitive task, because I always come out of it learning something new.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

	<p>{% blocktrans %}I strive to write programs that are stable and reliable, that play very nicely with the end-user, and that are designed with the future in mind (in terms of extensibility or in anticipating errors). Though Python has been my workhorse, it's not the only tool in my shed, and now that I'm going to be able to focus on programming I'm excited to acquire more skills and deepen those I already have.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

	<p>{% blocktrans %}I've always taken the craft of computer programming very seriously, and my background as a musician and language teacher has informed this: As a classical percussionist, in addition to learning several instruments well you are taught to learn how to learn a new paradigm. It was common that we would be expected to pick up a new instrument or notation system within a matter of a few weeks (because who else is going to play the musical saw for this show??). The way to survive our ever-changing environment was to learn the fundamentals: learn how your body moves, learn about musical structure, learn about sound itself. The same could be said of language and linguistics. To learn a foreign language you have to learn to manipulate a foreign, complex and highly structured system, and much of linguistics involves understanding the underlying principles behind human languages or the human language mechanism as a whole. Applying these concepts to computer programming, I want to always learn more about the fundamentals of writing and designing a good program: how it should be structured, how my code interacts with the machine it's being run on, understanding how the user will interact with a program, and how to write a program that is "safe" in every sense of the word.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

	<p>{% blocktrans %}After painstakingly segmenting and tagging recordings for a linguistics study about six years back, I was left with an excel spreadsheet that had about 5,000 lines with thirty columns, which I now had to edit, <em>by hand</em>. I swore that this would never happen again, and began to learn how to program, first starting with the scripting language created for use with the speech analysis program, Praat. While most of my colleagues generally hated dealing with the technical side of data collection and analysis, I loved it! Programming presents you with a million little problems to solve, which after a million curses eventually lead to a million little dopamine rushes. Since there is (and will always be) more to learn and more to create, I was hooked.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

	<p>{% blocktrans %}Over the next few weeks, I will gradually be cleaning up some of the code from projects I've worked on in the past and will post demos here and to <a href="https://github.com/dantheman39" target="_blank">my github page</a>. At time of writing my GitHub is still a little sparse, I've been using a personal git server for version tracking up to this point. But here is a simple list that gives an overview of the type of work I've done:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

	<ul class="dash-lis">
		<li>{% blocktrans %}I program regularly in Python, it's the language I've used the most and am most comfortable with.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}I have written and maintain multiple websites and web apps with the Django framework.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}Using and expanding on the amazing python library and application PsychoPy, I created a complex Vocabulary Trainer application for data collection in my thesis research. The program displayed images, played and recorded audio, graded and provided visual feedback for user input, used internationalization, allowed users to draw with a mouse, and used an algorithm that would vary presentation order depending on users' responses. I've contributed to PsychoPy's code, and have invested considerable time on the forums helping users with less technical experience.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}I am comfortable using JavaScript, and am always uncomfortable with how much more I have to learn about using it wisely. It seems that many programmers use JavaScript only because they are forced to, and that they don't take much interest in learning it well. I take the language seriously and want to learn it well. Crockford's <em>JavaScript, the Good Parts</em> is a book that is currently leading me to more thoughtful exploration of JavaScript.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

 		<li>{% blocktrans %}I successfully built a complex website for a client using a language and framework I had previously had no experience with: A colleague and I were hired as linguistic consultants by Missouri State University to create a placement test for their Spanish program. Part of my job was to create a website for them to administer the test and manage results. The university uses all Microsoft services and their programmers were unfamiliar with Django, so in order to facilitate their maintenance of the app I learned C# and ASP.NET MVC.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}SQL and data models: Usually in my projects SQLite has been sufficient, but I have also worked with MySQL and MSSQL. I've also worked with more abstract data model layers in Django and in ASP.NET.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}I built and maintain a home server, where I host most of my websites, and do some file, git and music serving.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}Ubuntu is my daily driver, and I am very comfortable on a Mac. I've used Windows plently, but have a lot to learn about its guts.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}Git is part of my regular workflow. I've been pushing to my home server instead of GitHub, but in the coming weeks I'll be cleaning up some more code and putting it on GitHub so it can be viewed by others.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
 
 		<li>{% blocktrans %}For data analysis and presentation, R and the fantastic ggplot2 package are my programs of choice.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
 
 		<li>{% blocktrans %}LaTeX made working on my thesis and other project write-ups simultaneously more fun and more infuriating.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}I'm a big fan of the Vim editor and it's gestural approach to moving around a file.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

		<li>{% blocktrans %}I've built some small desktop applications using PyQt.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
		<li>{% blocktrans %}I've written a <a href="http://praatscriptingtutorial.com" target="_blank">tutorial on the Praat scripting language</a> intended for other linguists with no programming experience.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
